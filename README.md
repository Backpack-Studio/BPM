# BPM - A C++ Header-Only Math Library

BPM (Backpack Mathematics) is a lightweight, header-only C++ math library designed to handle common mathematical operations.
It provides various utilities for vectors, matrices, quaternions, and basic mathematical operations like easing functions.

## Features

- **Vectors**: `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` – Basic vector types for 2D, 3D, and 4D spaces, with common vector operations.
- **Matrices**: `mat2`, `mat3`, `mat4` – Matrix types for 2D, 3D, and 4D transformations.
- **Quaternions**: `quat` – Representation and operations for quaternions.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Common mathematical utilities.

The library is simple, efficient, and easy to integrate into your C++ project.

## Installation

As BPM is a header-only library, you can easily integrate it into your project by copying the `include` folder into your project or by setting it up as an external dependency.

1. Download or clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BPM.git
