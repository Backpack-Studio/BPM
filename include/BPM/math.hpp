 * @brief Performs linear interpolation (lerp) between two angles in degrees.
 * 
 * This function performs linear interpolation (lerp) between two angles `start` and `end`
 * given in degrees, using the parameter `t` to determine the interpolation factor.
 * 
 * @tparam T The type of the angles (should be a floating-point type).
 * @param start The starting angle in degrees.
 * @param end The ending angle in degrees.
 * @param t The interpolation factor between 0 and 1.
 * @return The interpolated angle between `start` and `end`.
